# DATA SCIENCE/ML LEARNING : Vinayak Raja  
**Pricing Learning Data Science/ML:- Lets see how to use ML and what steps we need to take to reach there.**

*Python Basic EDA and learning Numpy and pandas*      

Before you start Jupyter, use this amazing [cheatsheet](https://www.cheatography.com/weidadeyue/cheat-sheets/jupyter-notebook/pdf_bw/).
    
Data scientist need to have these skills:

1. Basic Tools: Like python, R or SQL. You do not need to know everything. What you only need is to learn how to use **python**
1. Basic Statistics: Like mean, median or standart deviation. If you know basic statistics, you can use **python** easily. 
1. Data Munging: Working with messy and difficult data. Like a inconsistent date and string formatting. As you guess, **python** helps us.
1. Data Visualization: Title is actually explanatory. We will visualize the data with **python** like matplot and seaborn libraries.
1. Machine Learning: You do not need to understand math behind the machine learning technique. You only need is understanding basics of machine learning and learning how to implement it while using **python**.

### As a summary we will learn python to be data scientist !!!
